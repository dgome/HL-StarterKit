# Scope of Lab
_Enter the scope of the lab. This should include enough information to allow the Lab stewards to understand how it fits within Hyperledger's mission._

The scope of the lab is to have a single window for all hyperledger frameworks and tools projects to cover end-to-end custom generated example scripts for learners with all possible use cases to launch the blockchain network.
Learners can deploy it on any Linux or windows enabled docker systems to launch their network using this starter kit. 

For example, A fabric network was launched with sample CC, followed by explorer, caliper as a bundled to have visualized pitch and like extend to other  besu, burrow, explorer, caliper.
This tool will provide a complete end to end scripts to launch the network from the selected frameworks and tools. The learners will have pitch of hyperledger platform and get visualized with hyperledger tools, which is expected to attract more developer communities and use cases. 

As an MVP, a certain level of use cases and customization has done on Hyperledger fabric, explorer and can be applied on single-node, docker swarm, Kubernetes infra environments. However, this has to be expanded to other frameworks and tools.
